# GoT-Emotion-Mining

The main goal of this project is to analyze the change of emotions expressed during the course of the seasons of the Game of Thrones TV series.
For this to be achieved, emotion mining was applied on the transcripts of the sentences said by the characters of the series, during the first seven seasons. An exploratory analysis of this corpus was conducted by answering different word frequency related questions. For instance, the most frequently used words of each house were identified and different characters were compared in terms of the words they use most regularly. Different preprocessing techniques were applied on the text, in order to formulate it  and convert it into a more suitable format for the completion of the different tasks. For the extraction of the emotions, additional annotated datasets were retrieved and they were used in order to train traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, as well as a bidirectional LSTM. After being evaluated and compared to each other by implementing metrics like the Precision, Recall and F1-score, the best performing model was utilized on the initial corpus, to extract and analyze six basic emotions, namely; happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger.
